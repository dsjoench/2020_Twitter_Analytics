## INTRODUCTION
The Super Bowl 2020 drew 102 million viewers on Fox, Fox Deportes and Fox, NFL and Verizon’s digital properties. With a cost of $5.6 million per 30 seconds for this year's Super Bowl commercials, Fox Corporation earned around $600 million in total TV ads. Companies spent millions of dollars to build awareness of the products and services, while also trying to generate discussions among the wide audience around the ads themselves so they may receive additional exposure. For example, to become a viral video. So now the question is what business gets for the money spent? In this analytics competition, our team analyzes data collected from Twitter regarding Super Bowl commercials to find some business insights. 
## INFOGRAPHIC METRICS
In addition to the original dataset, we integrated other commercials’ information that was aired during the Super Bowl, including the length of commercials, the cost of each commercial, whether it is funny or conveys moral values, whether it includes a celebrity or not.
Also, we have created a new metrics Engagement to measure how tweets interacted online. It is defined as Engagement = retweeted_count+ reply_count+favorite_count. Second, in order to measure the effectiveness of each ad placed during the Super Bowl, we are using engagements divided by the duration of the commercials, to evaluate how much brand-related engagements that one-second ad can generate. The final takeaway of this analysis is to find the factors that contribute most to a successful investment in the commercial.

## ANALYSIS
The 5 biggest spenders on this year’s super bowl TV ads are NFL, Walmart, Tide, HardRockHotel, and Hyundai. 
They made up 20% of Fox’s total TV ad revenue. However, the dollar spent on TV ads did not necessarily translate to social media engagement. 

## Top 5 Brands that generate the most engagement per second of ad
The chart below shows the top 5 performers according to our KPI- engagement volume per second of ad. It was created by using KPI then we grouped it by the brand in sum. 
One second of advertisement costs approximately $186667, and we found that Metro Goldwyn Mayer took the lead and got over 4800 engagements per second. However, we cannot jump into conclusion yet before we dive deep into what actually happened.

Positive Influence on Engagement Volume
This chart below attempts to capture the brands with the right balance of proportion of positive tweets and engagement volume per second of ad invested. 
Surprisingly, The proportion of positive tweets for Metro Goldwyn Mayer (Bottom right) is relatively low compared to other brands despite its high engagement volume. That implies that even though Metro Goldwyn Mayer successfully got a lot of engagement on Twitter, it may not have a good chance that the tweets are positive. Interestingly, we observed that T- Mobile is at the optimal point where it has the best balance of positive tweets and engagement volume. 

Negative Influence on Engagement Volume
On the other hand, this chart displays the brands associating with the proportion of negative tweets and the engagement volume per one second of ad. Noticed that Soda Stream and Hard Rock Hotel have over 50 percent of negative tweets. Fortunately, they do not have a high engagement volume so the tweets may not be a huge negative influence on the brands. 


## Insights
Now our goal is to find if there are any factors that can contribute to a successful brand like T-Mobile who has a good volume of engagement and a high proportion of positive tweets. Is there any way other brands can do or avoid in order to get there? 
T-mobile — how they made it
We look into the tweets number about the t-mobile. We found the accounts that tweets about T-mobile are increasing significantly from 2019 to 2020. When we look closely into text details of the 2020 tweets, we found that the majority (76%) of the tweets are about the free phone raffle movement launched by the t-mobile official Twitter account.
 
With this in mind, we searched for the policy for the raffle. It turned out that the T-mobile gave away 300 smartphones during the super bowl streaming time. When it comes to cost, one reward with a smartphone and additional accessory credit costs $1857. And with 300 in amounts, the raffle campaign cost $ 557,100. The total cost is much lower than a 30 seconds super bowl commercial ($5,000,000). This would offer a new idea for promoting the product, that is, combining investing in TV commercials and giving away free reward can generate sizable social media awareness. 

In General — what should a commercial include?
T-mobile can give away free expensive smartphones, but it might not be a good idea for some brands to give away free awards. For example, a box of free mountain dew is not as attractive as the latest smartphone. So we try to figure out some more general ideas we can offer by categorizing commercials into different types. And for comparison, we use engagement per second of ad by category. 
Social Cause/ Emotional Vs Funny
We categorize the commercials to be moral values and funny by theme. Moral value means that the commercial is touching, or sending some positive emotion like patriotism or gender equality. And for others, we categorize as neutral. 
We can find out that funny commercials generally are more effective than Moral value commercials. 

Celebrity vs No celebrity
For those commercials related to TV drama or have a celebrity in them, we categorize them as celebrities. Others we categorize as no celebrity. 

We can find out that commercials related to TV drama or have a celebrity are more effective than commercials without celebrity. 
Long Vs Short
For those commercials longer than or equal to 45 seconds we categorize them as long commercials, for those commercials that are shorter than 45 seconds, we categorize them as short. 

We can find out that short commercials tend to have more effect than long commercials. 
Time — when is the best time for commercials? 
According to our analysis, the majority of tweets about commercials are in the 4th quarter. 


## Call to Action 
All in all, as the results we present above. The commercials are more effective when combining commercials and giving away rewards (how), consisting of short funny material with celebrities (what), and broadcasting in the 4th quarter. 

## Post-competition analysis

Magtitude = engagement per second * positive proportion/ negative proportion

It turns out that this is a better reflection and indicator of how much positivity from Twitter a second of ads can bring out. 

## Statistical Analysis
Hypothesis testing on length of ads to check if certain length of ads constitute a  significant difference on the metric
Used ANOVA to confirm that there is a significant difference at the duration group at 10% signficant level. Then I used post-hoc analysis to find out that 15 seconds is the only and most significant different among all. 

## Future Analysis 
Collect more data from past commerical played during the SuperBowl and test our hypothesis across multiple years 
Finding additional signficant factors that lead to a change of the metric over the past years
